HW Review and Future Plans

Hello!

I've joined the class after the 6 weeks of lecture have completed, and find it unlikely that I will find another online student at the same location as me, and with the same pace through the semester (I am a full-time employee, and have a limiting schedule).

However, if I find that another teammate cares to join, I will recruit!
